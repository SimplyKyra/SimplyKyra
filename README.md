# 👋 Hi, I'm Kyra a.k.a. **SimplyKyra**

I'm a curious indie developer and blogger who loves building small things that make life simpler whether that’s a playful iOS game, a reMarkable tablet tool, or a code-powered solution I just had to blog about.

On [SimplyKyra.com](https://www.simplykyra.com) you’ll find practical tutorials, app updates, and behind-the-scenes peeks at my creative experiments from SwiftUI quirks to Ghost theme tweaks. Beyond code there's also life with kids, sewing, and more. 
I'm on socials under @SimplyKyraApps or @SimplyKyra.

## ✨ What I Make

### 📱 Thoughtful Apple Apps
Clean, useful apps designed with intention:
- [Simply Customize It](https://www.simplykyra.com/simply-customize-it/) – tailor your reMarkable tablet with ease.
- [Simply Remember It](https://www.simplykyra.com/simply-remember-it/) – log when events happens. Less mental load.
- [Simply Match It](https://www.simplykyra.com/simply-match-it/) – a fun emoji-matching game built for family playdates.
- [Simply Uncover It](https://www.simplykyra.com/simply-uncover-it/) – a clean, modern twist on a classic puzzle.
- And working on more. <3

### 🧰 Creative Coding Solutions
From SwiftUI components to debugging edge cases, I share what I learn:
- Proud of my [custom SwiftUI picker](https://github.com/SimplyKyra/SimplyKyraBlog) that grew out of a [tutorial post](https://www.simplykyra.com/blog/update-to-my-custom-picker-with-multi-selection-in-swiftui-now-with-images/)
- Blog-first mindset: code that solves real problems and gets explained along the way

### ✍️ Tutorials for Real People
Most often about Swift, SwiftUI, and Ghost—always focused on clarity and practical use.
